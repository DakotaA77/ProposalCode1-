		<h1>Introduction </h1>
		<p>The general area to be studied will be the impact of language usage. Studying the impact language has on individuals is important because 
		language plays a large role in how we communicate within society and holds a lot of power.</p> 
		
		<p>Exclusive language can contribute to the harm of marginalized groups.I plan to specifically examine the way that gendered binary language, 
		including generic language, excludes/impacts women and nonbinary individuals at Portland State University.</p>
