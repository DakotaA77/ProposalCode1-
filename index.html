		<h1>Introduction </h1>
		
		<h2> What is this study about?</h2>
		<p>The general area to be studied will be the impact of language usage.Studying the impact language has on individuals has shown to be important because language plays a large role in how we communicate within society.How we choose to communicate holds a lot of power. Word choice can be critical especially when addressing impressionable students or speaking with or about marginalized communities.</p>

		<p>Exclusive language can come in many forms and directly contribute to the harm of marginalized groups. Inclusive language can make public spaces as well as private spaces feel safer for marginalized individuals. This study will focus specifically on  the way that gendered binary language, including generic language, excludes/impacts women and nonbinary individuals at Portland State University.</p>
