		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<p>I’ve chose the qualitative method of one-on-one interviewing of women and nonbinary students at PSU.
I chose this method for a few reasons:</p>
    <li>Personal interviews allow for better data on specific impacts of gendered language that you might not be able to find in other databases</li>
    <li>Participants will be able to self describe their gender instead of being categorized in a way that could be inaccurate
      (by sex like on the PSU By Numbers Page)</li>
    <li>My identity as a nonbinary student allows me access to first hand experience and relationships with other nonbinary students at PSU</li>
    <li>First hand experience is valuable and can be coded to see if there is an overlap or pattern in specific impacts</li>

    <h1> Participants: Women and nonbinary students at Portland State University</h1>
    <li>PSU is an academic space that uses gendered language that could impact or discourage students</li>
    <li>The focus is on students, specifically women and nonbinary students, who are disportionatly impacted by gendered language</li>
    
    <h1>Participants I Would Exclude:</h1>
    <li>People who don’t go to PSU as to keep the sample concise and specific</li>
    <li>PSU students who don’t identify as being nonbinary or women because their experience doesn’t pertain to the study questions</li>
    <li>PSU faculty because they are not students</li>
