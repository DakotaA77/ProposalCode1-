		<h1> Background Information and Literature Review</h1>
		<h1>Gendered Language. Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences by Bigler, & Leaper, C. (2015)</h1>
		<p>Gendered language contributes to gender biases by making gender salient, treating gender as a binary category, and causing stereotypic views of gender.
The study's primary interest follows the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis which holds that language shapes the way people perceive and think about the world.
The study focuses on the effects of gendered language on children’s conceptions of gender and is broken up into four sections: Manifestations of Gendered Language, Relations Between Gendered Language and Gendered Thought, Changing Linguistic Practices Around Gender and Values & Language Policies.This study also focuses specifically on the English language, but identifies genderless languages like Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, and Mandarin, who do not grammatically mark either nouns or pronouns. This study argues that in English it is nearly impossible to talk or write about other individuals without indicating their gender and, simultaneously, without forcing them into the category of male or female. The study concludes that altering linguistic input, including the elimination of routine gender labeling and the introduction of gender-neutral pronouns, is a pathway via which the gender binary and its associated constraints might be reduced

    <h1>Gendered Language and the Educational Gender Gap. Economics Letters by Davis & Reynolds(2018)</h1>
    <p>According to linguistic relativity theory, speaking a more heavily gendered language may highlight gender distinctions in the mind of the speaker, leading to more pronounced gender roles and greater disparities in social outcomes across genders. This study follows this theory and argues that countries in which the dominant language is more gendered have lower rates of female participation in labor and credit markets. They also show how speaking a gendered language is associated with lower rates of female labor force participation, early female marriage and a gendered division of labor in household tasks. This study’s primary ways of measuring gendered language is by identifying sex-based-nouns, assigning these nouns to different classes (semantic,formal or both) as well as looking at pronouns.
The study concludes that language with two sex-based noun classes is strongly associated with an increase in the gender gap in educational attainment, as measured by years of education and secondary school completion rates.

    <h1>What questions do these studies leave unresolved?</h1>
		<ul> 
			<li>How are students outside of the gender binary <i>specifically</i> impacted by gendered language? </li>
<li> Are students receptive to gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs) and/or neutral language being used in replacement of gendered language?</li>
<li> Is gendered language discouraging in academic spaces for women and those outside of the gender binary?</li>
<li> Does gendered language have an impact on nonbinary and women success rates in academic spaces?</li> </ul>
