		<h1>Rationale</h1>
    		<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
		<p>The questions I chose pertain to the impact language has, specifically how gendered language excludes/impacts women 
      and nonbinary individuals at Portland State University.</p>

    <p>My hypothesis would be that gendered language does discourage women and those outside of the gender binary in academic spaces. 
      The specific impacts will be different for women from those outside of the gender binary. Women will be impacted by generic language 
      that centers men (Ex. freshman). Those outside the gender binary will be impacted by binary language creating binary spaces (bathrooms, locker rooms, etc.) 
      as well as excluding them from conversations (Ex. saying welcome ladies and gentlemen).</p>
   
    <h2>If My Hypothesis is Confirmed</h2>
    <li>Give insight into how gendered language excludes/impacts women and nonbinary individuals</li>
    <li>Open up conversations about how to better linguistically include women and nonbinary students</li>
    <li>Open up a conversation around gender-based exclusion within academic spaces</li>
    
    <p>Because language usage is always going to impact individuals,my hypothesis canâ€™t really be disconfirmed</p>
