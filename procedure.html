		<h1>Questions I Would Ask</h1>
    <p> Do you identify with being a woman or falling outside of the gender binary?</p>
       <p>This question allows me to make sure the participant falls within our participant guidelines.This question also allows space for the participant 
       to self describe their relationship to gender</p>
        
    <p> Do you know what gendered language is?</p>
        <p>This question would open up the conversation and allow me to record the participants idea of what gendered language is 
          or give a definition for gendered language if they are not familiar with the term. Simple Definition: Gendered language refers to any form of 
          language which implies the gender identity of the person it is referring to </p>
        
    <p>Have you experienced the use of gendered language at PSU? In classrooms or around campus? Spoken or written out?</p>
        <p>This question allows participants to identify the use of gendered language in their academic space including possibly pinpointing
          specific times that gendered language stood out to them</p>
        
    <p>Do you feel like this gendered language can be discouraging? Is it discouraging for you?</p>
    <p>This question helps to answer our question of “Is gendered language discouraging in academic spaces for women and those outside of the gender binary?</p>
        
    <p>Could you give a specific example of how gendered language impacts you?</p>
    <p>This question helps to record the specific impacts of gendered language on these students</p>
       (Underline below line)
    <p>All of these questions are base-line questions which could segway into follow up questions to record more data if necessary 
      or if the participant is wanting to share further.</p>
  
    <p>A control is not necessary for this research because I am not comparing experiences, but instead collecting data on the experience of specific people.</p>
       
    		<h1>Procedure</h1>
     <p>I would like to promote this study using on campus locations where women and nonbinary students may be more likely to hear about it; 
       the women’s resource center and the queer resource center. </p>
    <p>The participants would most likely be volunteer based. The questions above will be asked in a one-on-one interview and  transcribed using a text tracker. 
      The participant will answer the questions and be asked to explain in detail. </p>
