		<h1>Analysis</h1>
		<h2> How will the data be analyzed? </h2>
		<p>The transcribed data will be coded to look for specific impacts that women and nonbinary students have experienced with gendered language at PSU. 
      The data will also be coded to look at any similarities or patterns. Patterns in the data would show whether women and nonbinary students are impacted 
      simalarily by gendered language at PSU.</p>
    
    <p>What kind of results would confirm your hypothesis?</p>
    <p>My hypothesis would be confirmed if the results showed that women and those outside of the gender binary have felt discouraged by gendered language at PSU. 
      In addition, it would be further confirmed if women had shared experiences or similar impacts when speaking about gendered language that pertained 
      to generic language, while  those outside the gender binary shared more similarity in discussing binary language creating binary spaces.</p>

	 <h1>Significance and Conclusion </h1>
		<h2> What impact will this study have?</h2>
    <p>Studying the impact language has on individuals is important because language plays a large role within our society. 
      The language we use contributes to power dynamics and accessibility. When we choose to use and normalize exclusive language, we contribute
      to the harm of marginalized groups. Other studies have shown the way binary gendered language can create stereotypic views of gender, 
      lower rates of female labor force participation and a gender gap in educational attainment. These studies are insightful, but center the impacts 
      that women face in a very broad context. My research includes not only women, but those who fall outside of the gender binary and how they are 
      <i>specifically</i> impacted by gendered language in academic spaces. The results of collecting data on this topic would help to further our knowledge on 
      how binary gendered language impacts students. It will also hopefully open up conversations about how to better linguistically include women and nonbinary 
      students as well as how to work past gender-based exclusion within academic spaces.</p>
